Values
    Every value is a piece is a data or data type and that data type determines how that value behaves.

    Some values are Numbers (ex: 86).
    Some values are Text (ex: “Hello world!”).
    Some values are Functions.

Variables
    Variables are named labels/identifiers for storing values.
    Remember from math class variables “x” and “y”?
    There are three ways to declare/create a variable in Javascript.

var 
    The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when the code is executed. (don’t use anymore)

let
    Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

const
    Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.

var, let, and const are reserved keywords in Javascript. You can’t use them for anything other than declaring variables.
