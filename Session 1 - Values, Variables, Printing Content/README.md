# Values
* Every value is a piece is a data or data type and that data type determines how that value behaves.
    * Some values are Numbers (ex: 86).
    * Some values are Text (ex: “Hello world!”).
    * Some values are Functions.

# Variables
* Variables are named labels/identifiers for storing values.
    * Remember from math class variables “x” and “y”?
    * There are three ways to declare/create a variable in Javascript.
    * var, let, and const are reserved keywords in Javascript for variables. 
        * You can’t use them for anything other than declaring variables.

# var 
* The most common variable. It can be reassigned but only accessed within a function. Variables defined with var move to the top when the code is executed.
    * This had fallen out of favor, avoid var when writing JS when possible.

# let
* Similar to const, the let variable can be reassigned but not re-declared.

# const
* Can not be reassigned and not accessible before they appear within the code.
